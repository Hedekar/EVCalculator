# EVCalculator
A project to build a cost calculator for switching cars

This website should take three main inputs:
- current vehicle
- possible gas vehicle purchase
- possible EV purchase

Along with multiple smaller inputs:
- current driving habits
- which province the user resides
- current gas prices
It will then calculate the cost-premium (how much extra cost) each option would have.

We will likely build this as an HTML page with some JavaScript running the life calculations.

A key feature of this will need to be striking a balance between ease-of-use and thoroughness of the calculation.

If possible we should eventually add discounted cash flow analyses and carbon cost analyses.  It would be ideal to pull from Canada's national databases for fuel efficiencies and historic gas price trends.  It would also be ideal if we could forecast gas pricing for years to come rather than simply using today's price point.
